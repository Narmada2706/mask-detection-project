# mask-detection-project

A CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm that can take in an input image and assign importance to different features in the image in the form of weights and bias. 
CNN is a specialized type of neural network, in the sense that it employs convolution in at least one of its layers.
In our proposed application, a CNN model can be trained on a set of images containing faces with and without masks. 
The final model should then be able to classify new, unobserved images of faces as having worn a mask or not.
