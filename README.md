A CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm that can take in an input image and assign importance to different features in the image in the form of weights and bias. 
CNN is a specialized type of neural network, in the sense that it employs convolution in at least one of its layers.
face-mask-detection Face Mask Detection is a project to determine whether someone is wearing mask or not, using deep neural network. It contains 3 scripts that provides training new model, testing model with specific images and live face mask detection.
